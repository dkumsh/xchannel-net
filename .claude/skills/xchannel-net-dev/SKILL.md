# xchannel-net — Development Guide

A network of **node managers** (one per node, `node ~= machine`) that turn local
[xchannel](https://github.com/dkumsh/xchannel) logs into network-visible, replicated channels. Provides
a **discovery service** and a **channel creation service**; the data plane replicates a
channel's records from its single owner node to read-only replicas on subscribing nodes.

**`DESIGN.md` at the repo root is the source of truth.** This skill is the fast-loading
orientation layer; when they disagree, DESIGN.md wins — and update both.

## Mental model (read this first)

- This is **single-writer log replication / pub-sub**, NOT remote rendezvous. The networked
  part is only the *management layer* (Nodes, name-based discovery, register/find); data
  semantics come from xchannel (persistent ordered replayable log). Nearest prior art:
  Aeron + Aeron Archive replication.
- **xchannel is single-writer.** ⇒ each logical channel has exactly one authoritative
  `Writer` on one owner node; every other node holds a **read-only replica**. There is
  **no consensus on the data path** — it is single-source fan-out. Preserve this invariant
  end-to-end; it is what keeps the system simple and fast.
- A **client never talks to a remote node directly** — only to its local manager, then
  reads/writes a purely local xchannel (the master it owns, or a synced replica).
- Records are self-describing (`msg_type: u16`, `length: u32`, `user_meta_u64`, payload).
  Replication = tail a `Reader` → ship each `User` record → `commit` into a `Writer` on
  the far side. Replicas are **record-identical, not byte-identical**.
- **Only `User` records cross the network.** `Roll`/`Skip` markers are local file
  artifacts of the source; the receiving `Writer` makes its own rolling decisions.
- **No-custody principle (DESIGN.md §5).** A node is a *forwarder + awareness service*,
  **never responsible for data** — unlike Kafka/NATS where `send()` transfers custody.
  The manager is **not in its own master's data path** (writer → mmap directly; manager
  only reads to forward). Manager death pauses remote forwarding but loses nothing; on
  restart it resumes from the last `RecordIndex`. **Restart = reconstruct, never restore
  from node-owned metadata**: rebuild from (data-dir scan + peer anti-entropy + clients
  reconnecting). The only durable node-owned state is **stable `NodeId` + config**.
  Ownership attaches to "this node holds the files," so a writer-less channel is
  *frozen but fully serveable*. **No node persists replication cursors** (DESIGN.md
  §5.2.1): the subscriber recovers its resume index and re-asserts it on (re)subscribe —
  neither source nor sink keeps a per-subscriber cursor.
- **`RecordIndex` is ABSOLUTE / genesis-relative**, source-authoritative (DESIGN.md §4).
  Resume index = `base + n` (records held), NOT a plain count — counting is wrong for a
  retention-truncated replica (`base > 0`). **No sidecar**: this is intrinsic in xchannel
  **v2** — each `ChannelHeader` carries `base_record_index` (immutable, file's first
  absolute index) + a per-file `message_count` of *user* records. Origin reads head via
  `Writer::next_record_index()`; replica via `Reader::base_record_index()` + records
  applied. Create a replica with `WriterBuilder::base_record_index(start)` so its headers
  are absolute. (xchannel ≤ v1's `message_count` was per-segment and counted skips — that
  was fixed by the v2 format change in the xchannel repo.)

## Locked design decisions (do not silently revisit)

| Area | Decision | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Owner death | Channel **freezes**, no failover | Same as a local writer stopping; *writer liveness* is an app concern, not ours. |
| Discovery | **Decentralized CRDT registry** | Last-writer-wins map keyed by `(registered_at_nanos, NodeId)`. No SPOF, no central name server. |
| Dissemination (v1) | **Eager broadcast + join-time anti-entropy + heartbeats** | NOT epidemic gossip / SWIM. Right for the expected **≤100 LAN nodes**. |
| Namespace | **Flat global names**, first-registrant-wins | Identity = the name; collisions resolved by the CRDT merge, loser gets `RegisterRejected`. |
| Initial pull | **Always full (retained) history** | Subscribing node materializes the whole channel; any local reader (Live/LateJoin) is instantly serviceable. |
| Redundancy / HA | **Post-v1, but keep 2 hooks** (DESIGN.md §9) | Absolute `RecordIndex` intrinsic in xchannel v2 `base_record_index` (done); name → *set* of endpoints (don't hard-bind one address). Same-machine redundancy = zero-downtime upgrades only, not machine HA. |
| Liveness | **Two separate concepts** | *Writer liveness* = app concern. *Membership liveness* (manager reachable) = ours, via heartbeats. Never conflate "no new messages" with "node down". |

Two liveness concepts and "retained history" honesty (`Gap`/`SubscribeAck.start` when
retention truncates) are subtle — keep them intact. Network positions use a logical
`RecordIndex` (counts `User` records); **never put xchannel byte offsets on the wire**.

```

**Convergence vs dissemination are separate concerns.** The registry merge is a fixed
CRDT; how deltas travel sits behind `Dissemination`. v1 = `BroadcastDissemination`;
future-at-scale = a `foca`-backed SWIM impl behind the same trait, registry untouched.

## Dependency policy

- Keep the project **synchronous and lean** — it mirrors xchannel's low-latency,
  control-over-the-hot-path ethos. Avoid pulling an async runtime (tokio) for v1.
- The **data plane must never ride a gossip/P2P mesh** — direct point-to-point only.
- Future SWIM (only if node count outgrows ~100): **`foca` 1.0.0** is the fit
  (runtime/transport-agnostic, `no_std+alloc`, no forced tokio). `chitchat` 0.11.0 is
  prior art but hard-depends on tokio. `libp2p`/gossipsub rejected (wrong scale/shape).
- `xchannel` is the substrate — the published crates.io release `xchannel = "4.0.0"` (the
  v2 format change has shipped). Key facts (Live/LateJoin, reserve/commit, file rolling,
  retention via `keep_files`, byte-offset resume) are mapped in DESIGN.md §1.
- **Verified: reopen-for-append** (`Writer::open_or_create` → `open_file`): a restarted
  writer reopens the latest segment without truncation, resumes at the persisted
  `write_position`, with bounded crash recovery (INV5). Load-bearing for §5; no special
  support needed.
- **Landed in xchannel (format_version 2)** for this project: `ChannelHeader` grew to 128
  bytes with `base_record_index` (intrinsic absolute index — killed the sidecar);
  `message_count` is now a per-file *user*-record count; new `Writer::next_record_index()`,
  `Reader::base_record_index()`, `WriterBuilder::base_record_index()`. Greenfield: refuses
  v0/v1 files, no migrator (the `migrate` module/example were removed). See the xchannel
  repo's `FORMAT.md` §3 + `CHANGELOG`.

## Conventions

- Rust **edition 2024**, toolchain 1.95. `cargo build --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace`.
- Commits: **single-line messages only — no body, no prose, no trailers** (incl. no
  `Co-Authored-By`). **No conventional-commit type prefix** — `feat`/`fix`/`docs` are
  redundant; use plain `scope: summary` (e.g. `core: …`, `client: …`, `docs: …` only when
  the scope genuinely is docs).
  Never run `git config`. Commit/push only when asked. (Same rules apply to the `xchannel`
  repo going forward; its existing commits are left as-is.)
- Scaffold stubs use `unimplemented!("<exact intended behavior>")` so the contract is
  pinned without pretending to work.

## Current status (update this section as work lands)

_As of 2026-06-22:_
- Dep is published **`xchannel = "4.0.0"`**. `.justfile` present in every commit; every
  commit passes `just check` (cargo check + fmt --check + clippy --all-targets).
- **v1 complete and hardened.** External client process → `Client` RPC → local `xchanneld`
  → gossip discovery + membership → cross-node replication. Hardening done:
  - **Self-healing subscriptions**: `Node::run_subscription` resumes from the replica head,
    reconnects on drop (backoff), and is stoppable (`Subscription::stop`/`unsubscribe`,
    socket shutdown to interrupt blocked reads). Idempotent `subscribe` RPC.
  - **Control-plane reconnection**: maintenance re-dials dropped seeds (tracked outbound
    peers, deduped, bounded `connect_timeout`).
  - **Replicas live under `data_dir/.replicas/<name>`**, distinct from origins
    (`data_dir/<name>`) — no collision when a node subscribes to a channel it also hosts.
  - **Cross-process test** spawns the real `xchanneld` and replicates via `Client` across
    processes (reads the replica — only possible cross-process). `Client::subscribe`
    retries the replica open (async creation race).
- ~28 tests across unit + two-node + client-RPC + cross-process; clippy clean; release builds.

## Security

Trust model + threats + reporting are in `SECURITY.md` (TL;DR: unauthenticated plaintext,
**trusted-network only**; defaults bind loopback, non-loopback bind warns). **Tier-0
hardening is done**: channel-name allowlist (no traversal/`.replicas` collision), absolute
daemon-spawn path (no `PATH` injection), lock-poison recovery (`util::MutexExt::lock_safe`),
`MAX_CONNECTIONS` cap on stream+client planes, `0700` data dir, 64 MiB frame cap.
**Tier-1 (required before any untrusted exposure) is future**: mTLS/Noise on all planes,
signed `ChannelIdentity` (don't trust `registered_at_nanos`/`owner`), authz, UDS for the
client plane.

## Next steps (post-v1 polish, optional)

1. **Auto-spawn hardening** — `connect_or_spawn` resolves an absolute path (no `PATH`), but
   doesn't `setsid`/daemonize; its exact wrapper isn't automated-tested (the cross-process
   test spawns the daemon directly).
2. **Deregistration / tombstones** (§8) — `Deregister` is on the wire but unhandled; an old
   `Register` can resurrect a removed name.
3. **Precise live-`head`** in `SubscribeAck` (currently `head = start` placeholder); a
   "synced" milestone signal.
4. **Membership pruning** — `Membership::forget_stale` exists but nothing calls it; the
   maintenance loop could prune dead peers.
5. **Observability / graceful shutdown** — daemon loops swallow errors (`let _ =`); no
   logging or clean shutdown.

## Open questions (see DESIGN.md §8)

Serialization codec; peer discovery (seed list vs config); backpressure/retention
coupling and `Gap` handling; security/auth of connections; multiple replicas of one
channel on a node + stream dedup; **registry tombstones** (deregister as deleted-flag +
timestamp in the merge); **registry liveness vs membership** ("known, owner unreachable"
vs "known and live").

---
**Maintenance note for the assistant:** keep this skill current as the project evolves —
when a decision changes, a stub becomes real, a crate is added, or a next-step completes,
update the relevant section (especially *Current status* and *Next steps*) in the same
change. Keep DESIGN.md and this skill consistent.
